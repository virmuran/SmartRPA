An advanced, set-and-forget automation tool for Microsoft Rewards. AutoRewarder performs Bing searches for PC and mobile point collection, collects Daily Sets, and uses mathematically driven, human-like input simulation (W3C Actions, Bezier curves, and smart scrolling).

Built with a robust Python/Selenium backend, it offers two modes of operation: a sleek HTML/CSS/JS frontend wrapped in a native window via pywebview, and a headless runner (CLI) for scheduled background runs and automation scripts. Packaged as an executable Windows app (via Inno Setup) for a seamless, plug-and-play experience.

## Installation

**Easy Way (Recommended):**
Download `AutoRewarder-Setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/safarsin/AutoRewarder/releases/latest) and run it. The installer will verify all dependencies and install the app for you.

**Portable Way:**
Download `AutoRewarder.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/safarsin/AutoRewarder/releases/latest) and extract it to any folder (e.g., a USB drive). Run the executable. All your settings and profiles will be saved locally inside the `config` folder.
> **Note:** Because the portable version is a single-file build, it may take a few seconds longer to start up compared to the installed version while it unpacks core components. Once open, it works at full speed.

**Manual Way (Source):**
Clone this repo, create virtual environment, and run `python AutoRewarder.py`.

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10 or later (installer), or Linux via source setup (no prebuilt executable)
- **Browser**: Microsoft Edge (driver managed by Selenium Manager)
- **.NET Framework**: 4.8 or higher (automatically checked by installer)
- **RAM**: Minimum 512 MB (1 GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: ~50 MB

---

## Features

**User Experience & Interface:**
- Multi-account management (add, rename, delete, per-account profiles)
- First Setup per account with a dedicated Edge profile
- PC and Mobile query controls (0-130 / 0-99)
- Optional hide-browser mode (headless UI toggle)
- Close-to-tray behavior with a tray menu (reopen or exit)
- Per-account scheduled runs (simple or advanced)
- Start with Windows/Linux toggle (autostart)
- Live terminal-like logs with update notifications (GitHub Releases)
- Local history view per account (date, time, query, status)
- Safe recovery for corrupted settings/history files

**Automation & Core Logic:**
- OS-level daily autostart (launches headless runs at per-account scheduled times)
- Configurable run pacing (advanced scheduling with run duration and queries per hour)
- Background WebDriver warmup at startup for faster execution
- Human-like search behavior (typing delays, random pauses, smooth scrolling)
- Mobile emulation for Rewards credit (iPhone UA and touch)
- Uses real-world queries from assets/queries.json (8154 unique entries from google-trends dataset)
- Randomized delays to reduce repetitive patterns
- Optional tab switching between result categories (Images/Videos/News)
- Natural mouse movement/clicking (W3C Actions)
- Daily Set task collection (runs once per day, per account)
- Separate browser profile per account

**Developer & Code Quality:**
- Advanced documentation (comprehensive docstrings and detailed guides)
- Strict code formatting and static type checking (Black, Flake8, MyPy)

## Quick Start (For Users)

You do not need Python to use release builds.

1. Download `AutoRewarder-Setup.exe` from the latest release
2. Install and run the app
3. Add your first account and complete setup
4. Set PC/Mobile counts and start a run

> **Tip:** Closing the main window sends AutoRewarder to the system tray. Use the tray icon to reopen the window or choose **Exit** to fully close the app.

For detailed guide, see [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)

---

## Development Setup (For Developers)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Run the app.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python AutoRewarder.py
```
---

## CLI Usage

For users who prefer the terminal or want to integrate the bot into custom scripts, a headless runner is available. It is the same engine used by the Start with Windows setting. You can call `AutoRewarder.py --headless` or run `AutoRewarder_CLI.py` directly (arguments are the same).

### Available CLI Arguments

These arguments can be combined. Without `--account`, it runs every enabled schedule sequentially.

| Argument | Type | Description | Default / Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--account` | String | Run only this account (by id or label). | Runs all enabled schedules. |
| `--pc` | Integer | Override PC queries for this run (requires `--account`). | Uses the account schedule. |
| `--mobile` | Integer | Override Mobile queries for this run (requires `--account`). | Uses the account schedule. |
| `--force` | Flag | Run even if already triggered today. | Skips accounts already triggered today. |

> **Note:** Headless mode is forced in the CLI and does not change the GUI Hide Browser preference.

---

### Example CLI commands:

```bash
# Run every enabled schedule (same as autostart)
python AutoRewarder.py --headless

# Run a single account once with overrides
python AutoRewarder.py --headless --account "Main" --pc 30 --mobile 20

# Force a re-run the same day
python AutoRewarder.py --headless --account "Main" --pc 30 --force
```

---

## Build & Distribution

**Build EXE (for installer creation):**
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --clean AutoRewarder.spec
```

**Create Windows Installer:**
```bash
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\iscc.exe" AutoRewarder.iss
```
Or use the Inno Setup IDE to open `AutoRewarder.iss` and compile it.
Output: `dist/AutoRewarder-Setup.exe`

## Runtime Data

The application stores its runtime files (profiles, history, logs, and settings) in a dedicated folder separate from your main browser.

**On Windows:**
```text
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\AutoRewarder
```

**On Linux:**
```text
~/.local/share/AutoRewarder
```

Created files and folders:
```text
settings.json      # Global settings (hide_browser, current_account_id, autoStartUp etc.)
accounts.json      # Account index
accounts/
	<account_id>/
		EdgeProfile/   # Separate Edge profile for WebDriver
		history.json   # Search history (date, time, query, status)
		status.json    # Daily Set completion status (per-day)
		meta.json      # Per-account metadata (first_setup_done, schedule)
background_log.txt # Logs from the background runner (for debugging)
```
